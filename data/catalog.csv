The instrument collects information about the size and pigment content of an individual cell and counts several thousands cells every second in real-time. The instrument utilizes light scattering and autofluorescence properties of individual cells to discriminate and quantify different cell populations that span 0.5-15 micrometer in size. The instrument is semi-autonomous and can be controlled remotely via Satellite connection.

The repeated CTD casts enable us to calculate an average density profile from which variability on tidal and near-inertial time scales has been removed. These average density profiles are useful for the comparison of dynamic height and for the comparison of the depth distribution of chemical parameters from different casts and at monthly intervals.

Very high frequency variability (< 6 h) and variability on time scales of between 3-60 d are not adequately sampled with our ship-based operations.

Water samples for a variety of chemical and biological measurements are routinely collected from the surface to within 10 m of the seafloor. To the extent possible, we collect samples for complementary biogeochemical measurements from the same or from contiguous casts to minimize aliasing caused by time-dependent changes in the density field. This approach is especially important for samples collected in the upper 350 m of the water column. Furthermore, we attempt to sample from common depths and specific density horizons each month to facilitate comparisons between cruises. Water samples for salinity determinations are collected from every water bottle to identify sampling errors. Approximately 20% of the water samples are collected and analyzed in duplicate or triplicate to assess and track our precision in sample analyses.

The repeated CTD casts enable us to calculate an average density profile from which variability on tidal and near-inertial time scales has been removed. These average density profiles are useful for the comparison of dynamic height and for the comparison of the depth distribution of chemical parameters from different casts and at monthly intervals.

The repeated CTD casts enable us to calculate an average density profile from which variability on tidal and near-inertial time scales has been removed. These average density profiles are useful for the comparison of dynamic height and for the comparison of the depth distribution of chemical parameters from different casts and at monthly intervals. This sampling strategy is designed to assess variability on time scales of a few hours to a few years. Very high frequency variability (< 6 h) and variability on time scales of between 3-60 d are not adequately sampled with our ship-based operations.

Water samples for a variety of chemical and biological measurements are routinely collected from the surface to within 10 m of the seafloor. To the extent possible, we collect samples for complementary biogeochemical measurements from the same or from contiguous casts to minimize aliasing caused by time-dependent changes in the density field. This approach is especially important for samples collected in the upper 350 m of the water column. Furthermore, we attempt to sample from common depths and specific density horizons each month to facilitate comparisons between cruises. Water samples for salinity determinations are collected from every water bottle to identify sampling errors. Approximately 20% of the water samples are collected and analyzed in duplicate or triplicate to assess and track our precision in sample analyses.

pbact_Chisholm,Enumerated flow cytometry abundance of Prochlorococcus,#*1e5/ml,Observation,In-Situ,Reprocessed,Chemistry+Biology+Biogeochemistry,Three Minutes,Irregular,"From http://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/cmoreDS/bextraction.html Some of this data is also from a dataset provided by the Chisholm Lab at MIT: Sally Chisholm, Paul Berube, Jessie Berta-Thompson, Allison Coe, Libusha Kelly. Jessie Thompson collected and ran samples, Paul Berube collected samples, and Allison Coe provided important advice on flow cytometry methods for challenging samples. PI: Sallie W. Chisholm, MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Samples were collected from the BiG RAPA cruise. For each of the 7 stations along the transect we took a depth profile of 9 samples across the euphotic zone; from these water samples we also preserved samples for other analyses (e.g. ecotype qPCR). In most cases these water samples are not from the same bottles or depths as cruise core measurement casts.  Depths at each station were chosen based on the location of the deep chlorophyll maximum, the mixed layer depth and light attenuation profiles. At station 7 we also participated in two high-resolution deep-chlorophyll maximum casts (times 2010-12-09 18:22:00 and 2010-12-10 18:17:10), and counts for these are included. Fixed samples for flow cytometry were collected by adding 5 ul of 25% glutaraldehyde to 1 ml whole seawater, mixing, and allowing sample to fix in the dark 10 minutes, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen or at -80C for 2-4 months before running flow cytometry. Two or three flow cytometry samples were preserved from each Niskin sampled, but only one of these sampling replicates was run. For each site and depth collected, a sample was run on a BD/Cytopeia Influx flow cytometer with 488 and 457 lasers both illuminating the sample and 2um fluorescent bead standards mixed in. No stains were used. Detector sensitivity ranges were optimized for Prochlorococcus and held constant throughout all runs. Each sample was thawed in the dark and run twice (flow cytometry technical duplicates). Replicates were run back to back, flushing the lines in between, so that samples were not left thawed for longer than ~ 1hr or put through extra freeze thaw cycles. Values in table are averages of the pair of technical duplicates.  As measurements, these values are good to ~2-3 significant digits (depending on the length of time a sample was run and the number of Prochlorococcus cells actually detected). Prochlorococcus counts were obtained by gating across chlorophyll fluorescence (680/40) vs. forward scatter using FlowJo software.  Gates were adjusted by hand separately for each sample, since the cell properties change dramatically across this dataset. Concentrations were calculated using sample run times, sample counts and measured flow rates. For surface/mixed layer samples with higher light exposure and smaller cells, many Prochlorococcus populations in this data set were just above or only partly above the fluorescence noise - these counts represent estimates likely on the low side (gating to avoid noise, faintly fluorescing cells undetectable), and they are not as accurate as estimates for the well-separated deeper populations.

Jessie Thompson collected and ran samples, Paul Berube collected samples, and Allison Coe provided important advice on flow cytometry methods for challenging samples. PI: Sallie W. Chisholm, MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Samples were collected from the BiG RAPA cruise. For each of the 7 stations along the transect we took a depth profile of 9 samples across the euphotic zone; from these water samples we also preserved samples for other analyses (e.g. ecotype qPCR). In most cases these water samples are not from the same bottles or depths as cruise core measurement casts.  Depths at each station were chosen based on the location of the deep chlorophyll maximum, the mixed layer depth and light attenuation profiles. At station 7 we also participated in two high-resolution deep-chlorophyll maximum casts (times 2010-12-09 18:22:00 and 2010-12-10 18:17:10), and counts for these are included. Fixed samples for flow cytometry were collected by adding 5 ul of 25% glutaraldehyde to 1 ml whole seawater, mixing, and allowing sample to fix in the dark 10 minutes, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen or at -80C for 2-4 months before running flow cytometry. Two or three flow cytometry samples were preserved from each Niskin sampled, but only one of these sampling replicates was run. For each site and depth collected, a sample was run on a BD/Cytopeia Influx flow cytometer with 488 and 457 lasers both illuminating the sample and 2um fluorescent bead standards mixed in. No stains were used. Detector sensitivity ranges were optimized for Prochlorococcus and held constant throughout all runs. Each sample was thawed in the dark and run twice (flow cytometry technical duplicates). Replicates were run back to back, flushing the lines in between, so that samples were not left thawed for longer than ~ 1hr or put through extra freeze thaw cycles. Values in table are averages of the pair of technical duplicates.  As measurements, these values are good to ~2-3 significant digits (depending on the length of time a sample was run and the number of Prochlorococcus cells actually detected). Prochlorococcus counts were obtained by gating across chlorophyll fluorescence (680/40) vs. forward scatter using FlowJo software.  Gates were adjusted by hand separately for each sample, since the cell properties change dramatically across this dataset. Concentrations were calculated using sample run times, sample counts and measured flow rates. For surface/mixed layer samples with higher light exposure and smaller cells, many Prochlorococcus populations in this data set were just above or only partly above the fluorescence noise - these counts represent estimates likely on the low side (gating to avoid noise, faintly fluorescing cells undetectable), and they are not as accurate as estimates for the well-separated deeper populations.
